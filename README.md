# StudentRegistrationSystem
A program that simulates a college student registration system that I wrote in my CS 232 class.


This is a program that I wrote in my CS 232 class, which was Computer Programming II. It is written in Java,
and as my short descriptions says, it simulates a students registration system. This project was assigned to my
class to teach us about inheritance and super-classes.

The core of this project is the Course class, which is the superclass for the program. It contains the members that
are shared by both the Traditional and Online classes that are used by the program.
